      Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is <strong>Seb</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martial arts and code development, had been part of my life since I have
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>Both,</p>
    <p>
      I can't count how many times I found myself using martial arts concepts in
      software development.
    </p>
    <p>This is an intent to share my vision that mixes these two worlds.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>I hope you enjoy it.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you are looking for an experienced developer don't forget to{" "}
