Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is **Seb**.

Martial arts and code development, had been part of my life since I have
memory.

I can't count how many times I found myself using martial arts principles
and concepts in software development.

This is a space where I will intent to share with you my vision that mixes these two worlds.

I'm not 100% sure about how yet, but I will work it out.

**Thanks to come by, I hope you'll find it enjoyable.**

Recommendations and feedbacks are always welcome. ðŸ˜Š

_**Have a great life.**_

_And if you are looking for an experienced developer don't forget to <a href="#contact">go here.</a>_
